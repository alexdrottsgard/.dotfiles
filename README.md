# Dotfiles for Dottsgard :)

This is a collection of my dotfiles. I use these to configure my system to my liking. I use these on my Arch Linux system, but they should work on any system that uses bash and zsh.

OBS: ðŸ‘† that was written with Copilot. I do not use Arch Linux... yet.

I started using nvim fall of 2023 and it has been enjoyable. It has also lead me to enjoy dotfiles more. With this in mind,
I am very new to this still :)

The dotfiles are managed with stow.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a script to install all the packages I use
  - [ ] List all the packages I use...

- [ ] nvim config
- [ ] uninstall oh-my-zsh
- [ ] install oh-my-zsh ... thanks copilot ðŸ¤¦
- [ ] tmux config

... to be continued
